msgstr "NAT and firewalls may be configured with an idle connection keep - alive duration. The situation is that if there is no traffic on a connection for a certain period of time, the connection will be closed. The symptom is that the packets sent from the sender to the institution are discarded. From the perspective of the sender's Envoy, TCP retransmissions are triggered, and from the perspective of the receiver's Envoy, the packets are directly discarded. "

msgid "在部署 Kuscia 的过程中，大概会出现以下三种不同的网络映射场景："

#: ../../deployment/networkrequirements.md:33
msgid "场景 1：机构与外网之间直接 4 层通信。"
msgstr "Scenario 1: Direct `Layer 4` communication between the institution and the external network. "

#: ../../deployment/networkrequirements.md:34
msgid "场景 2：外部访问机构侧，机构侧有前置的 7 层网关，需要走 7 层代理访问 Kuscia；Kuscia 访问外部正常直接 4 层出去。"
msgstr "Scenario 2: When accessing the institutional side from the outside, there is a front-end `Layer 7` gateway on the institutional side. Access to Kuscia needs to go through the `Layer 7` proxy; when Kuscia accesses the outside, it can normally go out directly at the `Layer 4`.  "

#: ../../deployment/networkrequirements.md:35
msgid "场景 3：机构侧有前置的 7 层网关，外部访问 Kuscia 走 7 层代理进来，Kuscia 访问外网也需要走 7 层代理出去。"
msgstr "Scenario 3: There is a front-end `Layer 7` gateway on the institutional side. When the outside accesses Kuscia, it comes in through the `Layer 7` proxy, and when Kuscia accesses the external network, it also needs to go out through the `Layer 7` proxy. "

msgstr "In Scenario 1, if there is a `Layer 4` SLB mapping to Kuscia, when configuring external nodes to access the Kuscia node of this institution, the authorized target address can use the IP address and front-end port exposed by the SLB to the outside.
