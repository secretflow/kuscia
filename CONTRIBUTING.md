## Coding Style

We stick to [Uber Go Style Guide](https://github.com/uber-go/guide/blob/master/style.md)

### Other tips

* Git commit message should be meaningful, we suggest imperative [keywords](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/git_commit_message#summary-keywords).
* Developer must write unit-test (line coverage must be greater than 80%), tests should be deterministic.
