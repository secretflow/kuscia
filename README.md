Kuscia(Kubernetes-based Secure Collaborative InfrA) is a lightweight privacy-preserving computing task orchestration framework based on K3s.
It provides a unified privacy-preserving computing foundation that can abstract away heterogeneous infrastructure and protocols.
With Kuscia:

- Lightweight deployment: You can perform privacy set intersection (PSI) on datasets with 1 million records using minimal resources of 1 CPU and 2 GB RAM.
- Cross-domain network security communication: You can achieve port reuse (requiring only one public network port) and secure communication during the concurrent execution of multiple privacy computing tasks.
- Unified API interface: You can integrate privacy-preserving computing capabilities using HTTP/GRPC API interfaces.
- Interconnection: You can interconnect with various privacy-preserving computing systems within the industry.

For more information about Kuscia's capabilities, please refer to the [Kuscia Overview](./docs/reference/overview.md).
